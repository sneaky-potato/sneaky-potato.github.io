The [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering) simply states the following

> We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection

Isn't this interesting? The more you read and think about it the context of software systems, the more it makes sense.
And that applies to all layers of abstraction that you know, starting from abstraction in programming languages like C++ to the abstraction in kernel modules and interfaces
