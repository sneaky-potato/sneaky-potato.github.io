[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) best known for his work on Lisp or his former startup Viaweb (later renamed Yahoo! Store)
But I got to know about this guy from the essays he's written and published on his website

You can have a look at the full list from [here](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html)

I've read [Good and Bad Procrastination](https://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) and [Trolls](https://paulgraham.com/trolls.html)
