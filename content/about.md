## Hi there

You are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-(tryhard?)-talk with me through this page.

*(Not one-sided anymore, thanks to [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), feel free to comment on this or any of my posts that you find interesting. **Dire** need of some activity here :P)*

I'm an undergraduate student from the department of **Computer Science and Engineering** at **Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**.

These days, I’m most excited about understanding how things work *under the hood* from language runtimes and kernel-adjacent systems to distributed systems internals and low-level performance behavior.

In my free time you'd probably find me watching some anime series, reading some book or reading one of the blogs I follow.

If you're bored, let's have a chat. I'd absolutely enjoy your views (and would love to give you my views on your views), thoughts, experiences.

At the time of writing of this page, I am on [Elmon](/blog/my-dynamic-duo) running **Pop OS**. (Although the page has been updated many times)

PS: If I ever happen to meet you for the first time I'm gonna stand next to you so I look like I know someone ok? *(._. )*

## Tech Stack

I love tinkering with systems and code sometimes.

I like to think of my background bit like a pizza. The base is Mathematics, the sauce is Engineering and Computer Science, and the toppings, well, the toppings will depend on the project that I’m working on at the time.

Over time, my interests have shifted strongly toward:

- **Systems programming** (C, Go, runtimes, performance)
- **Linux internals** and kernel-adjacent development
- **Distributed systems** and infrastructure software

I actively contribute to open-source projects in these areas including distributed systems and kernel-adjacent runtimes and I care a lot about correctness, performance, and maintainability.

There’s a dedicated page for that here: [open source contributions](/oss)


My GitHub [profile](https://github.com/sneaky-potato/) is usually the most accurate snapshot of what I’m currently hacking on.

## Non Tech Stack

I mostly listen to rock and related subgenres.

Not much of a bibliophile but I've particularly started enjoying reading satire, humor and dystopian (apparently).

I also follow documentaries on internet culture (both the bright and dark sides :skull:) and love curating creative works from the corners of the internet.
