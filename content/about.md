## Hi there

You are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-(tryhard?)-talk with me through this page.

*(Not one-sided anymore, thanks to [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), feel free to comment on this or any of my posts that you find interesting. **Dire** need of some activity here :P)*

I'm an undergraduate student from the department of **Computer Science and Engineering** at **Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**.

In my free time you'd probably find me watching some anime series, reading some book or reading one of the blogs I follow.

If you're bored, let's have a chat. I'd absolutely enjoy your views (and would love to give you my views on your views), thoughts, experiences.

At the time of writing of this page, I am on [Elmon](/blog/my-dynamic-duo) running **Pop OS**. (Although the page has been updated many times)

PS: If I ever happen to meet you for the first time I'm gonna stand next to you so I look like I know someone ok? *(._. )*

## Tech Stack

I love tinkering with stuff and code sometimes.

I like to think of my background bit like a pizza. The base is Mathematics, the sauce is Engineering and Computer Science, and the toppings, well, the toppings will depend on the project that Iâ€™m working on at the time.

I've worked in both frontend and  backend development. I've done courses on Image processing and Deep Learning. Also, recently I've started reading about software design patterns and have developed interest in systems.

My current OS is **Arch Linux**

My GitHub [profile](https://github.com/sneaky-potato/) would be a more accurate representation of this section I guess.

## Non Tech Stack

I mostly listen to rock and related subgenres.

Not much of a bibliophile but I've particularly started enjoying reading satire, humor and dystopian (apparently).

I also follow documentaries on internet culture (both the bright and dark sides :skull:) and love curating creative works from the corners of the internet.
