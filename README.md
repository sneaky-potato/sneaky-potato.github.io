# Little area for myself &middot;

>Wanting to exploit the easy deployment through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and content management using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), there I was, writing another one of my [TILs](https://sneaky-potato.github.io/til/)

Repository for personal webiste.

## Theme

Using the awesome [theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome) theme built for Hugo.

## Website structure

Just open it and see for yourself?

Ugh don't mind but there was no point of creating this README but then it wouldn't look good when I'd open the repo page :P

## Domain

GitHub pages.

## DNS and CDN Refernce

Everything from DNS records to SSL security and analytics is being managed by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) (Even Email routing, fantastic service tbh)
